//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
//Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified


const make_great = (magicianArray) => {
  let modifiedArray = magicianArray.map((name) => `The Great ${name}`);
  return modifiedArray;
};

let magicianArray = ["Ali", "Usman", "Umar", "Abubakar"];
console.log(make_great(magicianArray))
