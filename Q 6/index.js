//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let personName= " \tRana Mubashar Ali\n "
console.log(personName);
let nameWithoutSpace = personName.trim();
console.log(nameWithoutSpace)
